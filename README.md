Small python projects I do for fun.

1. Tic-tac-toe. Download the [file](./tic-tac-toe.py) and run it with:

   ```
   py tic-tac-toe.py
   ```

   Follow the prompts and you'll figure out how to play :)

1. [A small program](./requirements_sorter.py) to help you with finding a job.
   You input job requirements one by one, the program reads them and figures
   out which ones are more popular than others. When you're done, you get the
   final list of requirements sorted by popularity and a file with the same
   list.

1. [A simple IPv4 converter program](./ip_converter.py) that helps you figure
   out the network address, broadcast address, first and last usable addresses,
   and subnet mask based on an IP address and a prefix length. Here's an
   example with an IP address of **43.109.23.12 / 8**:
