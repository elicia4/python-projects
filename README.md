# Python Projects

Small python projects I do for fun.

1. Tic-tac-toe. Download the [file](./tic-tac-toe.py) and run it with:

   ```
   py tic-tac-toe.py
   ```

   Follow the prompts and you'll figure out how to play :)

1. [Small program](./requirements_sorter.py) to help you with finding a job.
   You input job requirements one by one, the program reads them and figures
   out which ones are more popular than others. When you're done, you get the
   final list of requirements sorted by popularity and a file with the same
   list.
